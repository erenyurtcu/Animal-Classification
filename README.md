# Animal Classification Project

## üìã Project Description
This project is part of a learning initiative aimed at understanding and implementing Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for image classification. The objective is to classify animal images, such as distinguishing between "panda" and "dog," using CNN models. Through this project, participants will:

- Explore the factors that contribute to a "good" model.
- Analyze the impact of model depth and parameter efficiency.
- Understand the sensitivity of CNNs to data manipulations and improve their resilience.

The project consists of four main steps, as outlined below. 

## üóì Steps in the Project
1. **Model Training and Testing:**
   - Build a CNN model.
   - Train and test the model on a dataset of animal images.
2. **Testing with Manipulated Images:**
   - Evaluate the model on test images manipulated under different lighting conditions.
   - Identify any performance degradation and analyze its causes.
3. **Color Constancy Algorithm Application:**
   - Apply a color constancy algorithm to correct manipulated images.
   - Retest the model and compare the performance.
4. **Result Analysis and Reporting:**
   - Compare test results across the three scenarios.
   - Suggest solutions for performance improvement if scores remain low.

The most effective model and proposed solution will have the opportunity for project presentation.
